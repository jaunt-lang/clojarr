Jaunt is a hard fork of Clojure. Rich Hickey wrote Clojure to be the language he wanted, and
administers it in the way that he wants. This is awesome, but I (Reid McKenzie) disagree with enough
of the choices made in the language and its administration that I've forked to go my own way.

See [the thesis blog post](https://www.arrdem.com/2016/02/22/clojarr_-_a_friendly_clojure_fork/) for
more on this.

## Getting Started

Jaunt should be supported by [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen),
[Inlein](https://github.com/hyPiRion/inlein), [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) (0.12
or later), and [Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/).

### With Leiningen

All that's required in order to use Jaunt in a leiningen project is to provide a profile wherein
Jaunt is listed as a dependency, and Clojure is listed as an exclusion. A minimal `project.clj`
which uses only Jaunt would be as such:

```clojure
(defproject some-jaunt-project "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :exclusions [org.clojure/clojure]
  :dependencies [[org.jaunt-lang/jaunt "1.9.0-RC4"]])
```

Simply jacking in with CIDER or via `lein repl` or starting a Cursive repl will drop you straight
into a Jaunt environment.

### With Inlein

All you need is a `jaunt.clj` like this

```clojure
'{:dependencies [[org.jaunt-lang/jaunt "1.9.0-RC4"]
                 [reply "0.3.7"
                  :exclusions [net.cgrand/parsley
                               org.clojure/clojure]]
                 [net.cgrand/parsley "0.9.3"
                  :exclusions [org.clojure/clojure]]]
  :jvm-opts     ["-XX:+TieredCompilation" "-XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1" "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8"]}

(reply.ReplyMain/main (into-array String ["--standalone"]))
```

`inlein jaunt.clj` will then drop you straight into a repl just like `lein repl`.

### With Boot

Unfortunately boot is not yet supported. Pull requests detailing usage with boot would be most
welcome.

## Goals

Jaunt is in no small part an experiment in what Clojure would look like if it had a different
contribution process, and was more willing to make bold/risky changes.

Unlike Clojure which is eminently stable, Jaunt is not guaranteed to be stable (yet). Some level of
breaking changes with Clojure will be accepted if there is a good reason for them.

## Administration

Currently, Jaunt is administered at my (Reid McKenzie's) sole discretion. Contributions, bug
reports, and feature requests are welcomed.

It must be stated this is a hobby project for me. I'll respond to issues and pull requests as I have
free time to consider and address them.

The EPL license reads

> THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
> EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ... FITNESS FOR
> A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

And that is the extent of the guarantees I offer with regards to this software. It is my goal to
maintain Jaunt in such a way that [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) works, and that
most compatibility with Clojure is maintained but this is not a hard guarantee. If you want a
Clojure compatible language, you're gonna have to use Clojure.

In the future when there are other active contributors, it is my desire to hand off issues and patch
reviews to volunteer contributors as they may choose to donate time. The precise mechanism by which
contributors may approve changes is undecided, but the goal is for significant contributors who have
demonstrated that they share some degree of respect for compatibility will be able to approve and
merge changes without my involvement.

## FAQ
> Will you support $LIBRARY/$PRODUCT?

No. They may work just fine, and you're welcome to offer changes continuing or preserving support as
well as to assist in preventing breakages but no degree of compatibility with Clojure, Cognitect
product or surrounding ecosystem is guaranteed or represented.

> Will you add $FEATURE/$PATCH from Clojure?

No. Under the EPL you may port changes from Clojure to Jaunt. However I make no promises of
merging or porting upstream changes.

> Will you add $FEATURE to the language?

Maybe. For the most part, it seems that `clojure.core` is shall we say "right sized". In the Scheme
tradition, the compiler works and the core is large enough that users can and have built just about
everything else you could want as a library. This leads me to believe that for the most part adding
features to the language isn't called for.

That said, I don't think the language is perfect. The Java implementation could use some spit and
shoeshine in my present estimation. The compiler could be smarter. The various "internal" APIs could
be reviewed, documented and published so that users can rely on them. There are some things which
clearly deserve to be added such as type predicates which are nearly universally defined by users,
but I expect this project to largely be one of refinement rather than one of novel development.
